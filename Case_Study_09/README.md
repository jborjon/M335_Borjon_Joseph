## Class notes

**John Rauser:** Summary statistics wash away a tremendous amount of detail.

When you track down the data and investigate outliers, you will almost always be rewarded. Be like John Snow from the 1854 cholera outbreak. Don't sweep outliers under the rug.

Sugar and tobacco industries have used "correlation does not imply causation" for a long time. Tiny minds confronted with data that challenges their beliefs or interests tend to say that. Yes, it's a true statement, but if you have good reason to believe that there is a causation and you investigate it, don't be dissuaded by the statement.

Just because your 3-year-old doesn't know a word doesn't mean you stop using it. As a data scientist, help supervisors and coworkers become more data literate.
