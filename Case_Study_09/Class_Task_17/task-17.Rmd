## Who won the contest?

My friend picked excellent stocks in the manufacturing area. He was thinking in the long term. I picked tech stocks that would probably see a good jump in a short time, since that was the point of the competition.

I did very well. My friend, not so much.

```{r plot_stocks}
```

The first plot is a summary of the daily total value of each portfolio. I started mine with $1,019.61 and he started his with $1,003.46, since the stock prices didn't exactly add up to $1,000.

The second plot shows the daily position value for each stock so we can see individual performance.
