MCS 335 repository for Borjon, Joseph_Huntley-Ashton coursework

I am a BYU-Idaho alumnus who took an interest in data science after graduating in business management. I went back to BYU-I, took a few data classes, and was hooked.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in data analytics from Western Governors University. I like computers but love people. What I like most about computers is their ability to help humans solve problems and make their lives better.
