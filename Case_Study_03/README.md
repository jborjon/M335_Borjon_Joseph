The following is a quote from [*What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets*](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets): "Learn about the elephant Unless the data is something I've analyzed a lot before, I usually feel like the blind men and the elephant."

It resonated with me because it feels like so much of life. You think you know something based on partial experience, only to be corrected by others who may or may not have a broader perspective.
