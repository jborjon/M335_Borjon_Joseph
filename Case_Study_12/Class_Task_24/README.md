## Class notes

Visualization is not rocket science, so if you learn the lingo, you can write papers.

Giving away code or information doesn't mean you don't get to do consulting for people anymore; it just means that then they ask you to do more stuff.

School doesn't teach you data intuition. I went through a master's degree and didn't really get what data was until about 5 years into work.

In real work, it takes a long time to get your data formatted, collected, and cleaned up, so you may often end up using most of your time to do that and then doing some quick, bad graphs that *almost* answer the question. Try to avoid that.

Avoid telling more than one story with graphs so people have trouble remembering the right one.

If we make graphs that add unnecessary information, we may draw attention to the wrong issue. There should be focus in them. Don't have people have to over-focus.

Most people are data-illiterate, so they just look at a graph and say, "Oh, okay. Let's go with that." You could really easily lie to them, so you need to be careful not to be dishonest, intentionally or otherwise. Strive to educate and make people better, don't just settle for bar charts because they are familiar and easy to get.



## [Stephen Few on Data Visualization: 8 Core Principles](https://www.tableau.com/blog/stephen-few-data-visualization)

Stephen Few: data visualization is just a tool, like hammers and saws. We could build houses before those tools, they just let us do it better *if* we have developed the skills to use the tools effectively.

Good data visualization takes the burden off the brain and puts it on the eyes. To do that, he suggests eight core principles, the "8-fold path":

  1. **Simplify.** Capture the essence of the data without oversimplifying.
  1. **Compare.** Don't make people hold the visualization details in their memory; shift the burden to the eyes. Let them compare visualizations side by side or provide visualization that juxtaposes the variables.
  1. **Attend.** Make it easy for the eye to attend to the data that's really important.
  1. **Explore.** You should be able to look, to explore data and discover things.
  1. **View diversely.** "Different views of the same data provide different insights."
  1. **Ask why.** Actionable results come from asking, "Why is it happening?" more than "What's happening?"
  1. **Be skeptical.** Question your first answer. Dig deeper.
  1. **Respond.** Answer more than your own questions. Share the data.

> The best software for data analysis is the software you forget you're using. It's such a natural extension of your thinking process that you can use it without thinking about the mechanics.



## [9 Questions for Data Viz Legend Stephen Few + 1 for You](https://interworks.com/blog/dmurray/2015/04/24/9-questions-data-viz-legend-stephen-few-1-you)

Building effective dashoards is hard because space and attention are limited.

The [bullet graph](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Bullet_Graph_Design_Spec.pdf) and [sparkline](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR) charts communicate a lot in little space, ideal for dashboards.

Stephen Few was influenced by the work of the following:

  * Edward Tufte
  * William Cleveland
  * Stephen Kosslyn
  * Colin Ware
  * Gene Zelazny
  * Robert Harris
  * Robert Horn

Data visualization needs creativity but not necessarily the abilities of a master artist.

> I don’t approach my work as an artist but as a scientist. I base my work on empirical evidence of the practices that work and an understanding of how and why they work.

Skilled "data sensemakers" have these and other traits in common:

  * Curiosity
  * Persistence
  * Self-actualization
  * Creativity
  * Critical thinking
  * Skepticism
  * Analytical (the ability to deconstruct things into their component parts)
  * Synthetical (the ability to connect the dots, to see how things relate to one another and work together)
  * Honesty
  * Good communication

These traits don't necessarily correlate closely with any one IT role.

> Another trait that I suspect is shared by most good data sensemakers is introversion – people who prefer to work alone, quietly exploring data, and are comfortable spending long hours in silence communing with data, weaving it into something meaningful and useful.

**Personal note:** the contrasting ideas of analysis and synthesis have made me realize I'm a skilled analyst but not quite as skilled a synthesist.

> I recommend that young people interested in this career [data analysis] study broadly, getting a good general education with exposure to many fields of study. What does matter is that in the process, they develop good critical thinking skills and become versed in the scientific method and statistics, at least at a basic level.

> Obviously, I read about data visualization, analytics, neuroscience and statistics, but I also read whatever grabs my interest. I always have at least one or two non-fiction books going and a novel, as well.

> Every opportunity that I’ve had to do the work of data sensemaking was one that I created by proving myself and then proposing a new role for myself that involved some aspect of data sensemaking that interested me at the time.

> Most of the information technology industry doesn’t have a clue about data visualization in particular or even data sensemaking in general. They seem to think that they can be experts in technology without being experts in the skills that technologies are meant to augment. They promote “technological solutionism” rather than the truth that technologies can only augment our thinking; they cannot do our thinking for us.

> None of the tools are yet doing a great job of supporting data visualization. Even the best tools are clumsy, overly complicated and plagued with useless and harmful features. Even if this weren’t the case and the tools were great, they would only be accessible to more information consumers if those consumers were trained in the requisite skills. This isn’t happening, in part because the vendors are promoting the myth that their tools are so great that anyone can use them without training. I’m not talking about training in using the tools but about training in the basic concepts, principles and practices that one must know to make sense of and communicate data.
