## Seismic activity (magnitude > 2.5) in North America between June 17 and July 17, 2018

Dot size represents the magnitude (smaller is lower). Since there have been no major earthquakes 

California and its county boundaries are highlighted because that area is by far the most interesting. I'm looking at you, San Francisco and LA.
