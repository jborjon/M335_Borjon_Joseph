## [Florence Nightingale Was Born 197 Years Ago, and Her Infographics Were Better Than Most of the Internet's](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/florence-nightingale-infographic)

### Coxcomb graphic critique

The results, to a large degree, speak for themselves: Florence's coxcomb graphic caused changes in behavior that led to measurable results. While we know from Cleveland's work and that of many others that area is not necessarily easy for the human brain to distinguish, the differences in her data are large enough that the differences are clearly shown.

That's quite impressive for someone who lived over a century before Cleveland. The graphs certainly look interesting, and they reward the audience for paying close attention. It must have been like nothing else seen in the 19th century.
