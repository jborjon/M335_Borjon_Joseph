## Conclusion

The plot above shows an encapsulation of each month's performance across the years 1990 to 1998. I was between 2 and 11 years old when these data were collected. Anyway, except for a few outliers, there isn't that much of an upward trend. Returns stay relatively consistent. DJIA was, again, tighter in spread than the other indices.
