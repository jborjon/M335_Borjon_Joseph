## Child mortality reduction

From the following visualization, it is stunningly evident that, the more a country spends on healthcare as a percentage of GDP, the fewer child deaths occur between the ages of 0 and 5.

```{r healthcare_data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ourworldindata)

financing_healthcare %>%
  filter(year == 2010, !is.na(child_mort), !is.na(health_exp_total)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(health_exp_total, child_mort, color = continent)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
      title = "Child mortality decreases drastically as health expenditure increases",
      x = "Total Healthcare expenditure as % of GDP",
      y = "Child mortalityper 1,000",
      color = "Continent"
    ) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
